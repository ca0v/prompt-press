Concept of Operations:

### Gap Analysis
- **ConOps gaps**: The existing ConOps comprehensively covers purpose, scope, operational environment (web-based play), user roles, scenarios, interfaces (with browsers and jsonbin.io for persistence), constraints, success criteria, and traceability. However, it does not detail specific geode powers (e.g., how Pyrite, Rose Quartz, etc., behave uniquely beyond being targets or pieces), which are implied but not specified in the requirements. It also lacks explicit operational workflows for fissure rotation effects on movement (e.g., which geodes can enter rotated cells), though this is partially addressed in game-board.req.md. The ConOps assumes balanced win rates but doesn't specify mechanisms for ensuring this in the operational concept. No major areas are unaddressed by the requirements overall, but these details could enhance completeness.
- **Requirement gaps**: The requirement overviews provide detailed specifications for the board layout, state management, rules enforcement, UI rendering, and faction pieces, which are well-reflected in the ConOps. However, faction.req.md is brief on geode powers (only stating they exist and are visually distinct), with no specifics on how powers affect gameplay (e.g., movement rules, capture abilities), which the ConOps assumes but doesn't detail. game-board.req.md has an updated overview that adds more on operational constraints and gameplay goals, which align but expand on the ConOps. game-state-manager.req.md, rules-engine.req.md, and ui-ux.req.md cover their components thoroughly, with no unaddressed aspects in the ConOps.
- **Completeness assessment**: The requirements sufficiently cover the operational concept for a web-based two-player game, including setup, gameplay, and win conditions, with good traceability. However, the system is not fully complete without detailed geode power specifications in faction.req.md, as these are critical for strategic scenarios and fairness. The updated overviews for game-board.req.md and faction.req.md improve alignment by adding operational context, but overall, the ConOps could be more detailed on interactions to fully operationalize the concept. No new major requirements are needed yet, but expanding faction.req.md with power details would bridge the gap.

### Recommended Updates
- **ConOps updates**: Incorporate details from the updated requirement overviews (e.g., explicit gameplay goals like "eroding the opponent's Pyrite" and operational constraints like browser responsiveness). Add a subsection in Operational Scenarios detailing geode powers (inferred reasonably as unique abilities for movement/capture, pending full specs). Enhance Requirements Traceability to note that faction.req.md needs expansion for powers. Update Success Criteria to reference balanced geode designs for 50/50 win rates.
- **Requirement updates**: Update game-board.req.md and faction.req.md overviews as provided in the user input, as they add operational context (e.g., turn alternation, constraints, and faction naming) that improves alignment with the ConOps. No changes needed for game-state-manager.req.md, rules-engine.req.md, or ui-ux.req.md, as they are well-aligned.
- **New requirements needed**: No new req.md documents are required at this time, but consider creating a "geode-powers.req.md" in the future to detail specific abilities (e.g., Pyrite's vulnerability, Quartz's movement boosts), as this would resolve the gap in strategic operational workflows.

### Updated Content
Below is the complete updated ConOps.md content, incorporating recommended changes. It has been revised for completeness, including inferred details on geode powers (e.g., unique abilities for strategic depth, based on requirement overviews), enhanced operational scenarios with fissure effects, and updated traceability. All elements (purpose, environment, roles, scenarios, interfaces, constraints, success criteria, traceability) are included, with reasonable inferences from requirements (e.g., geode powers enable unique interactions).

# Concept of Operations (ConOps)

## Executive Summary
Petrified is a two-player, turn-based strategy board game implemented as a web-based application. Players compete to erode the opponent's Pyrite geode by strategically placing and moving geodes on a 5x5 grid board featuring rotatable fissures. The game emphasizes strategic depth through unique geode powers and board interactions. This ConOps outlines how the system supports gameplay in a web environment, ensuring fair, rule-compliant experiences for users.

## Business Objectives
- Provide an engaging, accessible web-based strategy game that promotes strategic thinking and competition.
- Enable easy deployment and play in standard web browsers without requiring specialized hardware or software installations.
- Deliver a complete gaming experience, from setup to win/loss determination, with real-time state management and feedback.
- Success criteria: Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 80%+ via post-game surveys, with average game completion time under 15 minutes and win rates balanced (e.g., 50/50 for skilled players) through fair geode power designs.
- Value proposition: Offers a free, browser-based alternative to physical board games, combining collectible elements with dynamic strategy for casual and competitive players.

## Stakeholders
- **Players**: End-users (two per game session) who interact with the UI to place, move, and rotate elements, adhering to game rules. Responsibilities include turn-taking, strategic decision-making, and understanding geode powers.
- **Game Administrators/Developers**: Responsible for deploying and maintaining the web application, ensuring rules are enforced and UI is functional. They may handle future updates based on user feedback.
- **External Systems/Interfaces**: Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for rendering the UI hosted on GitHub Pages or other CDN. Data persistence will be satisfied using https://jsonbin.io/; users must paste an API key into the browser to create a shared game.

## Operational Concept
### Current State
Traditional board games require physical components, limiting accessibility and scalability. Players face challenges in setup, rule enforcement, and state tracking, leading to disputes or incomplete games. Web-based alternatives exist but often lack the tactile strategy of Petrified's rotatable fissures and unique geodes.

### Proposed Solution
The system operates as a web application where players access a responsive UI via browsers. The game board is a 5x5 grid with strata (home rows) and rotatable fissures. Players control identical factions of 5 geodes (Pyrite, Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, Quartz), each with unique powers (e.g., Pyrite as a key target for erosion, Rose Quartz for enhanced capture, Calcite for movement boosts, Amethyst for blocking, Quartz for fissure manipulation—details to be specified in faction.req.md). Turns involve placing/moving geodes, rotating fissures (which affect cell entry for certain geodes, e.g., blocking or allowing based on rotation), and capturing opponents. The rules engine validates actions, the state manager tracks changes, and the UI provides visual feedback. Play continues until one player's Pyrite is eroded (captured or unable to move).

### Operational Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: Game Setup and Initial Placement**: Players access the web app and select to start a new game. The board initializes with geodes in strata positions and fissures in neutral orientations. Player 1 places their first geode, rotating a fissure if desired. The UI updates in real-time, and the state manager records positions. (Addresses initial user interaction and state initialization from game-state-manager.req.md.)
- **Scenario 2: Turn-Based Gameplay and Strategy**: During a turn, a player selects a geode, chooses a valid move (validated by rules-engine.req.md), and optionally rotates a fissure (affecting movement, e.g., some geodes can enter rotated cells while others are blocked). If a capture occurs (e.g., landing on an opponent via geode power), the opponent's piece is removed. The UI highlights valid moves and provides feedback on game state. Play alternates until win conditions are met. (Covers turn sequencing, validation, captures, and fissure effects from rules-engine.req.md, game-board.req.md, and faction.req.md.)
- **Scenario 3: Endgame and Win Determination**: As pieces are captured, the state manager checks for the erosion of Pyrite. The UI displays a win/loss message, allowing players to restart or exit. (Addresses win/loss logic from rules-engine.req.md and state tracking from game-state-manager.req.md.)

## Functional Requirements Overview
The system must support geode placement/movement (with unique powers for strategy), fissure rotation (impacting cell access), turn validation, captures, and win/loss checks. It requires visual representation of the board, geodes, and fissures, with interactive UI elements for selection and feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements Overview
- **Performance**: Real-time updates with <2-second latency for moves in standard web browsers.
- **Security**: No sensitive data handling; basic input validation to prevent cheating.
- **Usability**: Responsive design for desktop/mobile, with accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
- **Scalability**: Support for single-session games; extensible to multiplayer if networked.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints**: Must run in modern web browsers (e.g., HTML5+ support); no offline mode; assumes stable internet for loading.
- **Business Constraints**: Two-player only; no monetization or user accounts initially.
- **Assumptions**: Players have basic web literacy; game rules are self-explanatory via UI tooltips; fissures' rotation effects are predefined and balanced; geode powers are fair to ensure 50/50 win rates.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk 1: Rule Misinterpretation Leading to Invalid Moves**: Mitigation - Robust validation in rules-engine.req.md and UI feedback.
- **Risk 2: Browser Incompatibility Causing UI Issues**: Mitigation - Cross-browser testing and fallback CSS from ui-ux.req.md.
- **Risk 3: State Loss During Play**: Mitigation - Client-side state persistence with warnings from game-state-manager.req.md.

## Future Considerations
Potential roadmap includes multiplayer over networks (requiring new networking.req.md), AI opponents, mobile app ports, and custom faction expansions for enhanced scalability and engagement.

## Gap Analysis
See the Gap Analysis section above in this document for details on alignment with requirements.

## Recommended Updates
See the Recommended Updates section above in this document for suggestions.

## Requirements Traceability
- **faction.req.md**: Addresses geode design, powers (e.g., unique abilities for movement and capture), and faction naming (The Crystalline Guard), supporting operational scenarios where players select and use geodes strategically (e.g., Pyrite as a key erosion target in endgame; note: specific powers need detailing for full operational workflows).
- **game-board.req.md**: Defines the board layout, mechanics, and operational constraints (e.g., fissure rotation affecting geode entry, strata as home rows), enabling operational workflows for piece placement, movement, and rotation in gameplay scenarios, including turn alternation and browser responsiveness.
- **game-state-manager.req.md**: Manages real-time state, ensuring operational consistency in tracking positions, turns, and captures during play.
- **rules-engine.req.md**: Enforces turn sequencing, validations, win conditions, and special rules (e.g., fissure effects, geode powers), critical for fair operational scenarios and decision-making.
- **ui-ux.req.md**: Provides the interactive web interface, facilitating user interactions in all operational scenarios with visual feedback and responsiveness.

# Pyrite Geode - Requirements

## Overview
The Pyrite geode is a critical component of the base faction known as "The Crystalline Guard" in the board game "Petrified." As defined in faction.req, Pyrite serves as the primary target piece that must be captured (eroded) to achieve victory, making it the opponent's key objective. It possesses a specific movement power allowing it to move one position in any direction on the 5x5 grid board, but it has no additional special powers beyond this movement ability. Pyrite must be visually distinct from other geodes (e.g., Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, Quartz) to facilitate gameplay identification. This requirement specification details the design, movement mechanics, capture rules, and visual aspects of the Pyrite geode, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the game's rules engine, state manager, and UI for strategic, turn-based play in a web-based environment.

## Functional Requirements
- FR-1: The Pyrite geode shall be included as one of the five geodes in the base faction "The Crystalline Guard," alongside Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, and Quartz.
- FR-2: The Pyrite geode shall have the special power to move exactly one position in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) on the 5x5 grid board during a player's turn, subject to board constraints such as fissure rotations that may block or allow entry into cells.
- FR-3: The Pyrite geode shall have no additional special powers beyond the movement ability specified in FR-2, ensuring balanced gameplay without extra advantages like enhanced capture or blocking.
- FR-4: The Pyrite geode shall be designated as the target piece for erosion (capture) to win the game, meaning the game ends when a player's Pyrite is captured by an opponent's geode landing on its position via a valid move.
- FR-5: The Pyrite geode shall be visually distinct, with unique graphical representation (e.g., a specific color, shape, or icon) to differentiate it from other geodes, as required for usability in the web-based UI.
- FR-6: The Pyrite geode shall be placed in the opponent's home row (strata) at game initialization and remain movable according to its power until captured or the game concludes.
- FR-7: The Pyrite geode's movement and capture shall be validated by the rules engine to prevent invalid actions, such as moving through blocked fissures or outside the board boundaries.
- FR-8: Upon capture, the Pyrite geode shall be removed from the board, triggering win/loss determination for the capturing player, with the game state manager updating accordingly.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: Performance - Movement and capture validations for the Pyrite geode shall occur in real-time with less than 500ms latency to maintain smooth gameplay in web browsers.
- NFR-2: Usability - The Pyrite geode's visual representation shall include intuitive cues (e.g., a highlight or label indicating it as the "target") to assist players in strategic decision-making, with support for accessibility features like screen reader compatibility.
- NFR-3: Maintainability - The Pyrite geode's movement rules and capture logic shall be implemented as configurable code modules, allowing easy updates without affecting other geodes.
- NFR-4: Scalability - The Pyrite geode's behavior shall support future expansions, such as custom factions, without requiring redesign of core movement mechanics.

## Questions & Clarifications
[AI-CLARIFY: Are there any specific visual design guidelines (e.g., color schemes or icons) for Pyrite beyond being "visually distinct"? How should fissure rotations specifically interact with Pyrite's one-position movement—e.g., does rotation block diagonal moves? Is there a need for additional balance mechanisms, such as Pyrite having limited moves to prevent stalemates?]
