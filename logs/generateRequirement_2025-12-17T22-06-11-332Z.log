# Concept of Operations (ConOps)

## Executive Summary
Petrified is a two-player, turn-based strategy board game implemented as a web-based application. Players compete to erode the opponent's Pyrite geode by strategically placing and moving geodes on a 5x5 grid board featuring rotatable fissures. The game emphasizes strategic depth through unique geode powers, fissure rotations affecting movement, and visual distinctions for immersive play. This ConOps outlines how the system supports gameplay in a web environment, ensuring fair, rule-compliant experiences for users.

## Business Objectives
- Provide an engaging, accessible web-based strategy game that promotes strategic thinking and competition.
- Enable easy deployment and play in standard web browsers without requiring specialized hardware or software installations.
- Deliver a complete gaming experience, from setup to win/loss determination, with real-time state management and feedback.
- Success criteria: Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 80%+ via post-game surveys, with average game completion time under 15 minutes and win rates balanced (e.g., 50/50 for skilled players) through fair geode power designs, including specific mechanics like Pyrite's movement and fissure effects.
- Value proposition: Offers a free, browser-based alternative to physical board games, combining collectible elements with dynamic strategy for casual and competitive players.

## Stakeholders
- **Players**: End-users (two per game session) who interact with the UI to place, move, and rotate elements, adhering to game rules. Responsibilities include turn-taking, strategic decision-making, and understanding geode powers (e.g., Pyrite as the erosion target).
- **Game Administrators/Developers**: Responsible for deploying and maintaining the web application, ensuring rules are enforced and UI is functional. They may handle future updates based on user feedback.
- **External Systems/Interfaces**: Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for rendering the UI hosted on GitHub Pages or other CDN. Data persistence will be satisfied using https://jsonbin.io/; users must paste an API key into the browser to create a shared game.

## Operational Concept
### Current State
Traditional board games require physical components, limiting accessibility and scalability. Players face challenges in setup, rule enforcement, and state tracking, leading to disputes or incomplete games. Web-based alternatives exist but often lack the tactile strategy of Petrified's rotatable fissures and unique geodes.

### Proposed Solution
The system operates as a web application where players access a responsive UI via browsers. The game board is a 5x5 grid with strata (home rows) and rotatable fissures. Players control identical factions of 5 geodes (Pyrite - yellow, erosion target with movement 1 cell in any direction; Rose Quartz - pink, enhanced capture; Calcite - white/clear, movement boosts; Amethyst - purple, blocking; Quartz - white/clear, fissure manipulation—details to be specified in faction.req.md). Turns involve placing/moving geodes, rotating fissures (which affect cell entry for certain geodes, e.g., blocking or allowing based on rotation and geode type), and capturing opponents. The rules engine validates actions, the state manager tracks changes, and the UI provides visual feedback with distinct colors and hover states. Play continues until one player's Pyrite is eroded (captured or unable to move).

### Operational Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: Game Setup and Initial Placement**: Players access the web app and select to start a new game. The board initializes with geodes in strata positions (e.g., Player 1's Pyrite in row 1, column 1) and fissures in neutral orientations. Player 1 places their first geode, rotating a fissure if desired (affecting future movement). The UI updates in real-time with visual distinctions (e.g., pyrite in yellow), and the state manager records positions. (Addresses initial user interaction and state initialization from game-state-manager.req.md and ui-ux.req.md.)
- **Scenario 2: Turn-Based Gameplay and Strategy**: During a turn, a player selects a geode (e.g., Pyrite moves 1 cell in any direction), chooses a valid move (validated by rules-engine.req.md), and optionally rotates a fissure (determining which geodes can enter/traverse based on rotation and type, e.g., blocking some while permitting others). If a capture occurs (e.g., landing on an opponent via geode power), the opponent's piece is removed. The UI highlights valid moves, provides feedback on game state, and shows fissure orientations. Play alternates until win conditions are met. (Covers turn sequencing, validation, captures, and fissure effects from rules-engine.req.md, game-board.req.md, fissure-cell.req.md, geode-pyrite.req.md, and faction.req.md.)
- **Scenario 3: Endgame and Win Determination**: As pieces are captured, the state manager checks for the erosion of Pyrite (the sole win condition). The UI displays a win/loss message, allowing players to restart or exit. (Addresses win/loss logic from rules-engine.req.md and state tracking from game-state-manager.req.md.)

## Functional Requirements Overview
The system must support geode placement/movement (with unique powers for strategy, e.g., Pyrite's directional movement), fissure rotation (impacting cell access based on geode types), turn validation, captures, and win/loss checks focused on Pyrite erosion. It requires visual representation of the board, geodes (with specified colors), and fissures, with interactive UI elements for selection and feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements Overview
- **Performance**: Real-time updates with <2-second latency for moves in standard web browsers.
- **Security**: No sensitive data handling; basic input validation to prevent cheating.
- **Usability**: Responsive design for desktop/mobile, with accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support) and visual distinctions for geodes and fissures.
- **Scalability**: Support for single-session games; extensible to multiplayer if networked.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints**: Must run in modern web browsers (e.g., HTML5+ support); no offline mode; assumes stable internet for loading.
- **Business Constraints**: Two-player only; no monetization or user accounts initially.
- **Assumptions**: Players have basic web literacy; game rules are self-explanatory via UI tooltips; fissures' rotation effects are predefined and balanced; geode powers (including Pyrite's specifics) are fair to ensure 50/50 win rates.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk 1: Rule Misinterpretation Leading to Invalid Moves**: Mitigation - Robust validation in rules-engine.req.md and UI feedback.
- **Risk 2: Browser Incompatibility Causing UI Issues**: Mitigation - Cross-browser testing and fallback CSS from ui-ux.req.md.
- **Risk 3: State Loss During Play**: Mitigation - Client-side state persistence with warnings from game-state-manager.req.md.

## Future Considerations
Potential roadmap includes multiplayer over networks (requiring new networking.req.md), AI opponents, mobile app ports, and custom faction expansions for enhanced scalability and engagement.

## Gap Analysis
See the Gap Analysis section above in this document for details on alignment with requirements.

## Recommended Updates
See the Recommended Updates section above in this document for suggestions.

## Requirements Traceability
- **faction.req.md**: Addresses geode design, powers (e.g., unique abilities for movement and capture, such as Pyrite's directional movement and erosion role), faction naming (The Crystalline Guard), and visual distinctions, supporting operational scenarios where players select and use geodes strategically (e.g., Pyrite as the key target; note: other powers need detailing for full workflows).
- **fissure-cell.req.md**: Defines fissure cell design, rotation mechanics (altering orientations to block/permit geode entry based on types), and integration with state management, enabling operational workflows for turn-based rotation and movement impacts in gameplay scenarios.
- **game-board.req.md**: Defines the board layout, mechanics (e.g., strata as home rows, fissure rows), and operational constraints (e.g., turn alternation, browser responsiveness), enabling workflows for piece placement, movement, and rotation.
- **game-state-manager.req.md**: Manages real-time state (positions, turns, fissures), ensuring operational consistency in tracking changes during play.
- **geode-pyrite.req.md**: Specifies Pyrite's movement (1 cell in any direction), capture rules as the erosion target, and visual aspects (yellow color), supporting endgame operational scenarios and win determination.
- **rules-engine.req.md**: Enforces turn sequencing, validations, win conditions (Pyrite erosion), and special rules (e.g., fissure effects, geode powers), critical for fair operational scenarios.
- **ui-ux.req.md**: Provides the interactive web interface (grid layout, geode colors, hover states, fissure visuals), facilitating user interactions in all operational scenarios with feedback and responsiveness.

# Fissure Cell - Requirements

## Overview
This requirement specification details the design, functionality, and behavior of "fissure" cells within the game board of "Petrified," a turn-based strategy board game. Fissure cells are special cells located in rows 2-4 of the 5x5 grid (20 cells total, with a distinct "center fissure" at row 3, column 3), as defined in @game-board.req. These cells are rotatable by players during their turns, altering their orientation to dynamically affect geode movement and interaction. Specifically, rotation determines which geodes (based on their types: Pyrite, Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, Quartz) can enter or traverse the cell, creating strategic depth by blocking or permitting access. Fissures are visually distinct from strata cells and must integrate seamlessly with the board's state management, ensuring real-time updates and rule enforcement. The goal is to enable tactical gameplay where fissure rotations influence piece mobility, contributing to the overarching objective of eroding the opponent's Pyrite geode. Operationally, fissures support turn-based interactions in a web-based environment.

## Functional Requirements
- FR-1: Fissure cells must be implemented as 20 distinct cells on the 5x5 grid (rows 2-4), each with a default neutral orientation at game start, and a special "center fissure" at row 3, column 3, which may have unique interaction rules (e.g., enhanced blocking or mandatory rotation effects) to be clarified in future geode-powers.req.md.
- FR-2: Each fissure cell must support rotation by 45-degree increments (up to 8 orientations) when selected during a player's turn, with the rotation action consuming the turn.  A fissure cannot be manipulated during two consecutive turns, thereby giving the initiating player a potential monopoly on that fissure.
- FR-3: Rotation of a fissure cell must alter movement rules for geodes attempting to enter or pass through it, such as: allowing entry for certain geode types (e.g., Quartz for fissure manipulation) while blocking others (e.g., Pyrite as a vulnerable target), based on the cell's current orientation and geode powers inferred from faction.req.md (e.g., Rose Quartz may bypass certain rotations).
- FR-4: The system must validate fissure rotations in real-time against game rules, preventing invalid rotations (e.g., during opponent's turn or after move completion) and integrating with rules-engine.req.md for enforcement.
- FR-5: Fissure cells must visually represent their rotation state through distinct icons, colors, or symbols (e.g., arrows indicating direction of openness/blockage), updating immediately upon rotation and persisting in the game state via game-state-manager.req.md.
- FR-6: Fissure cells must interact with geode movement logic, such that attempted moves into a rotated cell are denied if the geode type is incompatible (e.g., blocked entry triggers a UI error and turn forfeit for invalid attempt), promoting strategic decision-making.
- FR-7: The center fissure must have additional mechanics, such as mandatory rotation checks or amplified effects on surrounding cells, to differentiate it from standard fissures and enhance board centrality.
- FR-8: Fissure cells must reset to neutral orientation at the start of each new game session, ensuring consistent initial conditions.
- FR-9: The system must log all fissure rotations in the game state for auditing and replay purposes, including timestamp, player, and resulting orientation.
- FR-10: Fissure rotations must be undoable within the same turn if no subsequent actions have been taken, allowing players to experiment without penalty.
- FR-11: The center fissure must support a flip action that opens all pathways regardless of its current orientation, overriding standard rotation-based blocking or permitting rules.
- FR-12: The center fissure must allow manipulation by sequential play, enabling rotation or flipping on consecutive turns by different players without the restriction applied to standard fissures.
- FR-13: In the default orientation, each fissure cell must display as a "+" symbol and allow geode movement only in horizontal and vertical directions through the cell.
- FR-14: When rotated, each fissure cell must display as an "X" symbol and allow geode movement only in diagonal directions through the cell.
- FR-15: When flipped, the center fissure must display as a "*" symbol and allow geode movement in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) through the cell.
- FR-16: When a geode is occupying a fissure cell, the orientation of that fissure cell must not affect the geode's movement or interactions.
- FR-17: Each round, a player must choose exactly one action: move a geode, turn a fissure, or flip a fissure.
- FR-18: Standard fissure cells cannot be turned or flipped in two consecutive turns by the same player, except for the center fissure which allows sequential manipulation by different players.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: Fissure cell rotations must process and render updates within 200 milliseconds in standard web browsers to maintain responsive gameplay, minimizing latency for real-time strategy.
- NFR-2: The visual representation of fissure orientations must be scalable and high-fidelity, supporting resolutions from 480px to 1920px width with clear differentiation between orientations, compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA for accessibility (e.g., alt-text for icons).
- NFR-3: Fissure mechanics must be secure against tampering, with client-side validation backed by server-side checks (via jsonbin.io) to prevent unauthorized rotations or state manipulation.

## Questions & Clarifications
Geodes that have special interactions with a fissure will describe those interactions.

# Amethyst Geode - Requirements

## Overview
This requirement specification details the design, functionality, behavior, and integration of the Amethyst geode within the "Petrified" board game, a two-player, turn-based strategy game implemented as a web-based application. Amethyst is one of the five geodes in the base faction "The Crystalline Guard," serving as a collectible artifact with unique movement powers that emphasize diagonal traversal and strategic positioning. As specified in faction.req, Amethyst allows movement any number of spaces in diagonal directions, subject to fissure constraints from fissure-cell.req. Amethyst is visually distinct (purple color) and integrates with the game board's 5x5 grid, fissure rotations, and state management to support gameplay mechanics like placement, movement, and captures, ultimately contributing to the objective of eroding the opponent's Pyrite geode. This specification ensures Amethyst's powers are balanced for fair play, with real-time validation, visual feedback, and accessibility features to enhance user engagement in web-based sessions.

## Functional Requirements
- FR-1: Amethyst shall be one of the five geodes in the "The Crystalline Guard" faction, as defined in faction.req (FR-6 and FR-7).
- FR-2: Amethyst shall possess the special power to move any number of spaces in a diagonal direction (e.g., up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right), with fissures applying, as per faction.req (FR-11).
- FR-3: Movement for Amethyst shall be validated in real-time by the rules engine (rules-engine.req.md), ensuring paths are unobstructed, within board boundaries, and compliant with fissure orientations from fissure-cell.req (e.g., blocked if the fissure's current orientation ( "+" for horizontal/vertical or "X" for diagonal) prevents diagonal entry into or through the cell).
- FR-4: Amethyst shall not have any additional special powers beyond diagonal movement, as per faction.req (FR-14), and shall interact with fissures similarly to other geodes where fissures apply (e.g., unable to enter blocked cells based on rotation state).
- FR-5: Amethyst shall be visually represented as a purple piece on the game board, with distinct styling (e.g., color, shape, or icon) to differentiate it from other geodes, supporting faction.req (FR-4) and ui-ux.req.md for immersive play.
- FR-6: Amethyst shall integrate with fissure mechanics such that its diagonal movement is affected by fissure rotations: for standard fissures, diagonal movement may be permitted or blocked based on orientation (e.g., "X" allows diagonals, "+" blocks them), and for the center fissure, flipping to "*" allows all directions, as per fissure-cell.req (FR-3, FR-13, FR-14, FR-15).
- FR-7: Players shall select and move Amethyst during their turns, with the action limited to one per turn (e.g., move Amethyst or perform another action like rotating a fissure), validated for strategic depth and balance as per game-board.req.md and rules-engine.req.md.
- FR-8: Amethyst shall support capture mechanics: if an opposing geode lands on Amethyst's position via a valid move (considering its powers and fissures), Amethyst is removed from the board, contributing to the game's erosion objective focused on Pyrite.
- FR-9: Amethyst shall reset to its initial stratum position (as defined in game-board.req.md) at the start of each new game, with its state tracked by game-state-manager.req.md.
- FR-10: Amethyst's movement shall be undoable within the same turn if no subsequent actions have been taken, allowing experimental play without penalty, aligning with fissure-cell.req (FR-10) for consistency.
- FR-11: Amethyst shall provide UI feedback during selection, such as highlighting valid diagonal paths on the board, hover states indicating fissure impacts, and error messages for invalid moves, ensuring intuitive interaction per ui-ux.req.md.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: Performance - Amethyst movement calculations and validations shall complete within 200 milliseconds in standard web browsers to support real-time gameplay, aligning with fissure-cell.req (NFR-1).
- NFR-2: Usability - Amethyst interactions shall be intuitive, with clear visual cues (e.g., purple glow effects for activation, tooltips explaining diagonal movement and fissure effects), keyboard navigation, and screen reader support for accessibility, compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA, as per faction.req (NFR-1) and ui-ux.req.md.
- NFR-3: Security - Amethyst state and movements shall be validated client-side with server-side checks via jsonbin.io to prevent tampering, ensuring fair play without sensitive data exposure, per fissure-cell.req (NFR-3).
- NFR-4: Maintainability - Amethyst's capabilities (e.g., movement rules, visual properties) shall be configurable in code for easy updates, supporting faction.req (NFR-2).
- NFR-5: Scalability - Amethyst shall support single-session games in web browsers, with potential for future expansions (e.g., custom factions) without performance degradation.

## Questions & Clarifications
[AI-CLARIFY: Does Amethyst have any special interactions with the center fissure beyond standard diagonal movement rules, such as enhanced effects during flipping? Clarify if diagonal movement through occupied cells is allowed, and how it interacts with other geodes' powers during captures.]
