# Concept of Operations (ConOps)

## Executive Summary
Petrified is a two-player, turn-based strategy board game implemented as a web-based application. Players compete to erode the opponent's Pyrite geode by strategically placing and moving geodes on a 5x5 grid board featuring rotatable fissures. The game emphasizes strategic depth through unique geode powers, fissure rotations affecting movement, and visual distinctions for immersive play. This ConOps outlines how the system supports gameplay in a web environment, ensuring fair, rule-compliant experiences for users.

## Business Objectives
- Provide an engaging, accessible web-based strategy game that promotes strategic thinking and competition.
- Enable easy deployment and play in standard web browsers without requiring specialized hardware or software installations.
- Deliver a complete gaming experience, from setup to win/loss determination, with real-time state management and feedback.
- Success criteria: Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 80%+ via post-game surveys, with average game completion time under 15 minutes and win rates balanced (e.g., 50/50 for skilled players) through fair geode power designs, including specific mechanics like Pyrite's movement and fissure effects.
- Value proposition: Offers a free, browser-based alternative to physical board games, combining collectible elements with dynamic strategy for casual and competitive players.

## Stakeholders
- **Players**: End-users (two per game session) who interact with the UI to place, move, and rotate elements, adhering to game rules. Responsibilities include turn-taking, strategic decision-making, and understanding geode powers (e.g., Pyrite as the erosion target).
- **Game Administrators/Developers**: Responsible for deploying and maintaining the web application, ensuring rules are enforced and UI is functional. They may handle future updates based on user feedback.
- **External Systems/Interfaces**: Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for rendering the UI hosted on GitHub Pages or other CDN. Data persistence will be satisfied using https://jsonbin.io/; users must paste an API key into the browser to create a shared game.

## Operational Concept
### Current State
Traditional board games require physical components, limiting accessibility and scalability. Players face challenges in setup, rule enforcement, and state tracking, leading to disputes or incomplete games. Web-based alternatives exist but often lack the tactile strategy of Petrified's rotatable fissures and unique geodes.

### Proposed Solution
The system operates as a web application where players access a responsive UI via browsers. The game board is a 5x5 grid with strata (home rows) and rotatable fissures. Players control identical factions of 5 geodes (Pyrite - yellow, erosion target with movement 1 cell in any direction; Rose Quartz - pink, enhanced capture; Calcite - white/clear, movement boosts; Amethyst - purple, blocking; Quartz - white/clear, fissure manipulation—details to be specified in faction.req.md). Turns involve placing/moving geodes, rotating fissures (which affect cell entry for certain geodes, e.g., blocking or allowing based on rotation and geode type), and capturing opponents. The rules engine validates actions, the state manager tracks changes, and the UI provides visual feedback with distinct colors and hover states. Play continues until one player's Pyrite is eroded (captured or unable to move).

### Operational Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: Game Setup and Initial Placement**: Players access the web app and select to start a new game. The board initializes with geodes in strata positions (e.g., Player 1's Pyrite in row 1, column 1) and fissures in neutral orientations. Player 1 places their first geode, rotating a fissure if desired (affecting future movement). The UI updates in real-time with visual distinctions (e.g., pyrite in yellow), and the state manager records positions. (Addresses initial user interaction and state initialization from game-state-manager.req.md and ui-ux.req.md.)
- **Scenario 2: Turn-Based Gameplay and Strategy**: During a turn, a player selects a geode (e.g., Pyrite moves 1 cell in any direction), chooses a valid move (validated by rules-engine.req.md), and optionally rotates a fissure (determining which geodes can enter/traverse based on rotation and type, e.g., blocking some while permitting others). If a capture occurs (e.g., landing on an opponent via geode power), the opponent's piece is removed. The UI highlights valid moves, provides feedback on game state, and shows fissure orientations. Play alternates until win conditions are met. (Covers turn sequencing, validation, captures, and fissure effects from rules-engine.req.md, game-board.req.md, fissure-cell.req.md, geode-pyrite.req.md, and faction.req.md.)
- **Scenario 3: Endgame and Win Determination**: As pieces are captured, the state manager checks for the erosion of Pyrite (the sole win condition). The UI displays a win/loss message, allowing players to restart or exit. (Addresses win/loss logic from rules-engine.req.md and state tracking from game-state-manager.req.md.)

## Functional Requirements Overview
The system must support geode placement/movement (with unique powers for strategy, e.g., Pyrite's directional movement), fissure rotation (impacting cell access based on geode types), turn validation, captures, and win/loss checks focused on Pyrite erosion. It requires visual representation of the board, geodes (with specified colors), and fissures, with interactive UI elements for selection and feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements Overview
- **Performance**: Real-time updates with <2-second latency for moves in standard web browsers.
- **Security**: No sensitive data handling; basic input validation to prevent cheating.
- **Usability**: Responsive design for desktop/mobile, with accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support) and visual distinctions for geodes and fissures.
- **Scalability**: Support for single-session games; extensible to multiplayer if networked.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints**: Must run in modern web browsers (e.g., HTML5+ support); no offline mode; assumes stable internet for loading.
- **Business Constraints**: Two-player only; no monetization or user accounts initially.
- **Assumptions**: Players have basic web literacy; game rules are self-explanatory via UI tooltips; fissures' rotation effects are predefined and balanced; geode powers (including Pyrite's specifics) are fair to ensure 50/50 win rates.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk 1: Rule Misinterpretation Leading to Invalid Moves**: Mitigation - Robust validation in rules-engine.req.md and UI feedback.
- **Risk 2: Browser Incompatibility Causing UI Issues**: Mitigation - Cross-browser testing and fallback CSS from ui-ux.req.md.
- **Risk 3: State Loss During Play**: Mitigation - Client-side state persistence with warnings from game-state-manager.req.md.

## Future Considerations
Potential roadmap includes multiplayer over networks (requiring new networking.req.md), AI opponents, mobile app ports, and custom faction expansions for enhanced scalability and engagement.

## Gap Analysis

- **ui-ux.req.md**: Provides the interactive web interface (grid layout, geode colors, hover states, fissure visuals), facilitating user interactions in all operational scenarios with feedback and responsiveness.


Requirement Overviews:
faction.req.md:
This requirement specification outlines the design and implementation of a collection of 5 unique geodes, each possessing distinct special powers. The geodes are intended as collectible artifacts for use in the board game "petrified". Each geode must be visually distinct as each piece will have unique powers on the game board. The base faction consists of Pyrite, Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst and Quartz and is collectively called **The Crystalline Guard**. Operationally, players control these geodes in web-based sessions, selecting and moving them strategically during turns, with Pyrite serving as the critical erosion target, under constraints like real-time validation and balanced win rates to promote user engagement.

---

fissure-cell.req.md:
This requirement specification details the design, functionality, and behavior of "fissure" cells within the game board of "Petrified," a turn-based strategy board game. Fissure cells are special cells located in rows 2-4 of the 5x5 grid (20 cells total, with a distinct "center fissure" at row 3, column 3), as defined in @game-board.req. These cells are rotatable by players during their turns, altering their orientation to dynamically affect geode movement and interaction. Specifically, rotation determines which geodes (based on their types: Pyrite, Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, Quartz) can enter or traverse the cell, creating strategic depth by blocking or permitting access. Fissures are visually distinct from strata cells and must integrate seamlessly with the board's state management, ensuring real-time updates and rule enforcement. The goal is to enable tactical gameplay where fissure rotations influence piece mobility, contributing to the overarching objective of eroding the opponent's Pyrite geode. Operationally, fissures support turn-based interactions in a web-based environment.

---

game-board.req.md:
This requirement specification details the design and functionality of the game board for the board game "Petrified." "Petrified" is a turn-based strategy game involving piece placement on a grid, with the end result being to capture all of the opponents pieces. It is a two-player web-based game, where players access the board via standard web browsers and interact through a responsive UI to place, move, and rotate elements in real-time. The board is laid out as follows:

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pyrite | Rose Quartz | Calcite | Amethyst | Quartz |
| 2 | Fissure | Fissure | Fissure | Fissure | Fissure |
| 3 | Fissure | Fissure | Center Fissure | Fissure | Fissure |
| 4 | Fissure | Fissure | Fissure | Fissure | Fissure |
| 5 | Pyrite | Rose Quartz | Calcite | Amethyst | Quartz |

The game board is a 5x5 grid structure that serves as the playing surface, where players interact with both game pieces and the board itself according to the game's rules. The board must visually represent the grid, support piece placement and movement, and provide feedback on game state. The physical board is composed of 25 "cells". Each player plays with a "faction" of 5 "geodes". Both players play with identical factions and each faction is composed of 5 distinct types of geode. Each geode has a different skill, allowing it to behave uniquely. The "cells" in rows 2-4 can be rotated to affect how the "geode" interacts with that cell. The cells in rows 1 and 5 are called "strata" and these are the home positions for each faction. The baseline faction is made of Pyrite, Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst and Quartz. The cells in rows 2-4 can be rotated affecting movement characteristics of most geodes, allowing some to enter the cell and others to be blocked from entering. The goal of the game is to "Erode the other players Pyrite"; every faction must contain at least one piece Pyrite. Operationally, players alternate turns, with constraints such as browser-based responsiveness and no offline play, ensuring fair, interactive gameplay.

---

game-state-manager.req.md:
The Game State Manager is responsible for maintaining and managing the overall state of the game board, including tracking the current active player, the count and positions of remaining game pieces, and the status of any fissures on the board. Fissures are circular pieces that fit within a cutout in each cell of the grid, present in rows 2-4, with rows 1 and 5 being the home rows for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. This component ensures that all state changes are valid, consistent, and accessible to other game components such as the game engine, UI renderer, and player input handlers. It must support initialization from a default or loaded state, real-time updates during gameplay, and querying capabilities for decision-making logic.

---

geode-amethyst.req.md:
This requirement specification details the design, functionality, behavior, and integration of the Amethyst geode within the "Petrified" board game, a two-player, turn-based strategy game implemented as a web-based application. Amethyst is one of the five geodes in the base faction "The Crystalline Guard," serving as a collectible artifact with unique movement powers that emphasize diagonal traversal and strategic positioning. As specified in faction.req, Amethyst allows movement any number of spaces in diagonal directions, subject to fissure constraints from fissure-cell.req. 

Only Amethyst can be on purple lines. (The purple line is on the back of the Center Fissure). 

Amethyst can move one space in any direction to get on purple lines.

Amethyst is visually distinct (purple color) and integrates with the game board's 5x5 grid, fissure rotations, and state management to support gameplay mechanics like placement, movement, and captures, ultimately contributing to the objective of eroding the opponent's Pyrite geode. This specification ensures Amethyst's powers are balanced for fair play, with real-time validation, visual feedback, and accessibility features to enhance user engagement in web-based sessions.

---

geode-pyrite.req.md:
The Pyrite geode is a critical component of the base faction known as "The Crystalline Guard" in the board game "Petrified." As defined in faction.req, Pyrite serves as the primary target piece that must be captured (eroded) to achieve victory, making it the opponent's key objective. It possesses a specific movement power allowing it to move one position in any direction on the 5x5 grid board, but it has no additional special powers beyond this movement ability. Pyrite must be visually distinct from other geodes (e.g., Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, Quartz) to facilitate gameplay identification. This requirement specification details the design, movement mechanics, capture rules, and visual aspects of the Pyrite geode, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the game's rules engine, state manager, and UI for strategic, turn-based play in a web-based environment.

---

geode-rose-quartz.req.md:
The Rose Quartz Geode is a specialized game piece in the "Petrified" board game, part of each player's faction of five distinct geodes (Pyrite, Rose Quartz, Calcite, Amethyst, Quartz). As described in the game-board.req, Rose Quartz is placed in the strata (home positions) in row 1, column 2 for Player 1 and row 5, column 2 for Player 2 in the initial 5x5 grid layout. It is a unique geode type with enhanced capture abilities, allowing it to capture opponent pieces more effectively than standard geodes, such as capturing adjacent opponents or bypassing certain fissure blocks. Rose Quartz is visually represented as pink and supports strategic gameplay by enabling aggressive plays to erode the opponent's Pyrite. This specification outlines its functional and non-functional requirements to ensure integration with the game board's grid, fissure rotations, and win conditions focused on Pyrite erosion.

---

rules-engine.req.md:
The Game Rules Engine is a software component responsible for enforcing the core mechanics of Petrified. It manages turn sequencing to ensure fair play, validates all proposed moves for legality and adherence to game rules, handles capture mechanics for removing opponent pieces, determines win/loss conditions based on game state, and applies any special rules including the effects of rotating fissures on the board and faction-specific rules for geodes. This engine must integrate seamlessly with a game board state manager and user interface to provide a complete, rule-compliant gaming experience. The engine should be modular to support different games by configuration.

---

ui-ux.req.md:
This requirement specification details the web components, HTML structure, and CSS styling necessary to implement the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for the game board, faction pieces (geodes), and fissures in the web-based version of the board game "Petrified." It builds upon the game board layout and geode definitions from the referenced requirements, ensuring a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing web interface. The implementation must support a 5x5 grid layout, visually distinct geodes with hover and selection states, rotatable fissures in specific rows, and overall game state feedback. The UI should be built using modern web technologies, prioritizing accessibility, performance, and cross-browser compatibility. The goal of the game is to "Erode the other players Pyrite"; every faction must contain at least one piece Pyrite.

Five starter geodes have been identified and should be colored as follows:
pyrite (yellow), rose-quartz (pink), calcite (white/clear), amethyst (purple), quartz (white/clear)

Analyze the alignment between the ConOps and the requirement overviews (or generate ConOps if none exists). Identify gaps and provide updated content for both ConOps.md and any requirement overviews that need changes.

Ensure the ConOps includes references to the specific req.md documents and briefly describes what operations each requirement addresses.

=== AI Response ===
### Gap Analysis
- **ConOps gaps**: The existing ConOps document covers the overall game concept, scenarios, and high-level geode powers (e.g., Pyrite's movement and role as erosion target), but it does not detail the specific powers and mechanics for other geodes like Amethyst (diagonal movement, purple lines) and Rose Quartz (enhanced capture abilities). These are now addressed in new requirement overviews (geode-amethyst.req.md and geode-rose-quartz.req.md), but the ConOps lacks references to them and does not incorporate their operational implications (e.g., how Amethyst's diagonal movement or Rose Quartz's capture rules affect turn-based strategies). Additionally, the ConOps assumes geode powers are fully detailed in faction.req.md, but faction.req.md provides a high-level overview without the granular mechanics now specified in the individual geode req.md files.
- **Requirement gaps**: The requirement overviews provide detailed mechanics for individual geodes (e.g., Amethyst's purple lines and movement rules, Rose Quartz's capture enhancements), but the ConOps does not reflect these in its operational scenarios, traceability, or success criteria (e.g., no mention of balancing win rates with these specific powers). The ConOps references only a subset of the provided req.md files (missing geode-amethyst.req.md and geode-rose-quartz.req.md), leading to incomplete traceability. Some overviews (e.g., game-state-manager.req.md, rules-engine.req.md) emphasize integration and validation, but the ConOps could better detail how these support real-time play with the new geode mechanics. No major aspects are missing from the overviews themselves, but they could be inferred to require minor updates for consistency with the ConOps (e.g., ensuring faction.req.md cross-references the individual geode req.md).
- **Completeness assessment**: The current requirements and ConOps are largely aligned for the core game mechanics (board, fissures, state management, rules, UI, and Pyrite), providing sufficient coverage for a functional web-based game. However, the addition of detailed geode-specific req.md (amethyst and rose quartz) fills previous gaps in strategic depth, making the overall set more complete. With updates to incorporate these, the requirements fully support the operational concept, including balanced gameplay, real-time interactions, and win conditions. The system is operationally ready for implementation, but the ConOps needs expansion for comprehensive documentation.

### Recommended Updates
- **ConOps updates**: Update the references to include geode-amethyst.req.md and geode-rose-quartz.req.md. Expand the Operational Scenarios section to detail how Amethyst's diagonal movement and purple lines, and Rose Quartz's capture abilities, integrate into gameplay (e.g., in Scenario 2: Turn-Based Gameplay and Strategy). Update Requirements Traceability to include the new files, describing their contributions to operations (e.g., Amethyst's strategic positioning, Rose Quartz's aggressive plays). Revise success criteria to mention balancing with these specific powers. Ensure all geode powers are briefly summarized in the Operational Concept for completeness.
- **Requirement updates**: The provided requirement overviews are largely sufficient, but minor updates are recommended for consistency and cross-referencing to align with the updated ConOps and ensure all geode req.md are linked. Specifically:

# Concept of Operations (ConOps)

## Executive Summary
Petrified is a two-player, turn-based strategy board game implemented as a web-based application. Players compete to erode the opponent's Pyrite geode by strategically placing and moving geodes on a 5x5 grid board featuring rotatable fissures. The game emphasizes strategic depth through unique geode powers (e.g., Pyrite's directional movement, Rose Quartz's enhanced captures, Amethyst's diagonal traversal and purple lines, with Calcite and Quartz powers to be detailed), fissure rotations affecting movement, and visual distinctions for immersive play. This ConOps outlines how the system supports gameplay in a web environment, ensuring fair, rule-compliant experiences for users.

## Business Objectives
- Provide an engaging, accessible web-based strategy game that promotes strategic thinking and competition.
- Enable easy deployment and play in standard web browsers without requiring specialized hardware or software installations.
- Deliver a complete gaming experience, from setup to win/loss determination, with real-time state management and feedback.
- Success criteria: Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 80%+ via post-game surveys, with average game completion time under 15 minutes and win rates balanced (e.g., 50/50 for skilled players) through fair geode power designs, including specific mechanics like Pyrite's movement, Rose Quartz's capture enhancements, and Amethyst's strategic positioning to ensure equitable gameplay.
- Value proposition: Offers a free, browser-based alternative to physical board games, combining collectible elements with dynamic strategy for casual and competitive players.

## Stakeholders
- **Players**: End-users (two per game session) who interact with the UI to place, move, and rotate elements, adhering to game rules. Responsibilities include turn-taking, strategic decision-making, and understanding geode powers (e.g., Pyrite as the erosion target, Rose Quartz for aggressive captures, Amethyst for diagonal mobility).
- **Game Administrators/Developers**: Responsible for deploying and maintaining the web application, ensuring rules are enforced and UI is functional. They may handle future updates based on user feedback.
- **External Systems/Interfaces**: Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for rendering the UI hosted on GitHub Pages or other CDN. Data persistence will be satisfied using https://jsonbin.io/; users must paste an API key into the browser to create a shared game.

## Operational Concept
### Current State
Traditional board games require physical components, limiting accessibility and scalability. Players face challenges in setup, rule enforcement, and state tracking, leading to disputes or incomplete games. Web-based alternatives exist but often lack the tactile strategy of Petrified's rotatable fissures and unique geodes.

### Proposed Solution
The system operates as a web application where players access a responsive UI via browsers. The game board is a 5x5 grid with strata (home rows) and rotatable fissures. Players control identical factions of 5 geodes (Pyrite - yellow, erosion target with movement 1 cell in any direction; Rose Quartz - pink, enhanced capture (e.g., adjacent opponents); Amethyst - purple, diagonal movement any number of spaces and access to purple lines; Calcite - white/clear, movement boosts; Quartz - white/clear, fissure manipulation—details to be specified in faction.req.md and individual geode req.md). Turns involve placing/moving geodes, rotating fissures (which affect cell entry for certain geodes, e.g., blocking or allowing based on rotation and geode type), and capturing opponents. The rules engine validates actions, the state manager tracks changes, and the UI provides visual feedback with distinct colors and hover states. Play continues until one player's Pyrite is eroded (captured or unable to move).

### Operational Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: Game Setup and Initial Placement**: Players access the web app and select to start a new game. The board initializes with geodes in strata positions (e.g., Player 1's Pyrite in row 1, column 1) and fissures in neutral orientations. Player 1 places their first geode, rotating a fissure if desired (affecting future movement). The UI updates in real-time with visual distinctions (e.g., pyrite in yellow), and the state manager records positions. (Addresses initial user interaction and state initialization from game-state-manager.req.md and ui-ux.req.md.)
- **Scenario 2: Turn-Based Gameplay and Strategy**: During a turn, a player selects a geode (e.g., Pyrite moves 1 cell in any direction, Rose Quartz captures adjacent opponents, Amethyst traverses diagonally or accesses purple lines on the center fissure), chooses a valid move (validated by rules-engine.req.md), and optionally rotates a fissure (determining which geodes can enter/traverse based on rotation and type, e.g., blocking some while permitting others). If a capture occurs (e.g., landing on an opponent via geode power like Rose Quartz's enhancements), the opponent's piece is removed. The UI highlights valid moves, provides feedback on game state, and shows fissure orientations. Play alternates until win conditions are met. (Covers turn sequencing, validation, captures, and fissure effects from rules-engine.req.md, game-board.req.md, fissure-cell.req.md, geode-pyrite.req.md, geode-rose-quartz.req.md, geode-amethyst.req.md, and faction.req.md.)
- **Scenario 3: Endgame and Win Determination**: As pieces are captured, the state manager checks for the erosion of Pyrite (the sole win condition). The UI displays a win/loss message, allowing players to restart or exit. (Addresses win/loss logic from rules-engine.req.md and state tracking from game-state-manager.req.md.)

## Functional Requirements Overview
The system must support geode placement/movement (with unique powers for strategy, e.g., Pyrite's directional movement, Rose Quartz's capture enhancements, Amethyst's diagonal mobility and purple lines), fissure rotation (impacting cell access based on geode types), turn validation, captures, and win/loss checks focused on Pyrite erosion. It requires visual representation of the board, geodes (with specified colors), and fissures, with interactive UI elements for selection and feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements Overview
- **Performance**: Real-time updates with <2-second latency for moves in standard web browsers.
- **Security**: No sensitive data handling; basic input validation to prevent cheating.
- **Usability**: Responsive design for desktop/mobile, with accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support) and visual distinctions for geodes and fissures.
- **Scalability**: Support for single-session games; extensible to multiplayer if networked.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints**: Must run in modern web browsers (e.g., HTML5+ support); no offline mode; assumes stable internet for loading.
- **Business Constraints**: Two-player only; no monetization or user accounts initially.
- **Assumptions**: Players have basic web literacy; game rules are self-explanatory via UI tooltips; fissures' rotation effects are predefined and balanced; geode powers (including Pyrite's, Rose Quartz's, and Amethyst's specifics) are fair to ensure 50/50 win rates.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk 1: Rule Misinterpretation Leading to Invalid Moves**: Mitigation - Robust validation in rules-engine.req.md and UI feedback.
- **Risk 2: Browser Incompatibility Causing UI Issues**: Mitigation - Cross-browser testing and fallback CSS from ui-ux.req.md.
- **Risk 3: State Loss During Play**: Mitigation - Client-side state persistence with warnings from game-state-manager.req.md.

## Future Considerations
Potential roadmap includes multiplayer over networks (requiring new networking.req.md), AI opponents, mobile app ports, and custom faction expansions for enhanced scalability and engagement.

## Requirements Traceability
- **faction.req.md**: Addresses geode design, powers (e.g., unique abilities for movement and capture, such as Pyrite's directional movement and erosion role, Rose Quartz's enhanced captures, Amethyst's diagonal traversal), faction naming (The Crystalline Guard), and visual distinctions, supporting operational scenarios where players select and use geodes strategically (e.g., Pyrite as the key target; note: other powers like Calcite and Quartz need detailing for full workflows).
- **fissure-cell.req.md**: Defines fissure cell design, rotation mechanics (altering orientations to block/permit geode entry based on types), and integration with state management, enabling operational workflows for turn-based rotation and movement impacts in gameplay scenarios.
- **game-board.req.md**: Defines the board layout, mechanics (e.g., strata as home rows, fissure rows), and operational constraints (e.g., turn alternation, browser responsiveness), enabling workflows for piece placement, movement, and rotation.
- **game-state-manager.req.md**: Manages real-time state (positions, turns, fissures), ensuring operational consistency in tracking changes during play.
- **geode-pyrite.req.md**: Specifies Pyrite's movement (1 cell in any direction), capture rules as the erosion target, and visual aspects (yellow color), supporting endgame operational scenarios and win determination.
- **geode-rose-quartz.req.md**: Details Rose Quartz's enhanced capture abilities (e.g., adjacent opponent removal), visual aspects (pink color), and integration with board and fissures, enabling aggressive strategic plays in turn-based scenarios to erode Pyrite.
- **geode-amethyst.req.md**: Defines Amethyst's diagonal movement (any number of spaces), purple line access (on the center fissure), and visual aspects (purple color), supporting operational workflows for strategic positioning and traversal in gameplay.
- **rules-engine.req.md**: Enforces turn sequencing, validations, win conditions (Pyrite erosion), and special rules (e.g., fissure effects, geode powers including those from geode-amethyst.req.md and geode-rose-quartz.req.md), critical for fair operational scenarios.
- **ui-ux.req.md**: Provides the interactive web interface (grid layout, geode colors, hover states, fissure visuals), facilitating user interactions in all operational scenarios with feedback and responsiveness.
